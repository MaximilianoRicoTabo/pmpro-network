### Welcome to the Paid Memberships Pro - Member Network Sites GitHub Repository

Create a network site for the member as part of membership to the main site.

Allow a member to purchase one or more sites as part of membership. Once configured, the member can purchase membership at the network’s main site (the primary domain of the network) and specify the “Site Name” and “Site Title” for their new site on the network.

Any sites attached to a member will be deactivated when membership expires or cancels.
